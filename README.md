# tinyhttp
A minimal HTTP response (and request) parser

This is java port of [Matthew Endsley](https://mendsley.github.io/2012/12/19/tinyhttp.html)'s [tinyhttp](https://github.com/mendsley/tinyhttp) state-machine HTTP parser which I've also modified to be able to handle http request messages as well as multipart/form-data content.
